- blueprint: video-text-pivot (Adapt)
- focal: assets/user/clip-7317-open-box-top.mp4
- roles: clip-7317-open-box-top = background (full-bleed, data-media-start 1.0 so the lid lifts inside the frame; deep-ink gradient on the top ~40%)
- sfx: none
- cues: "Before I Do" 0.05 · "משחק קלפים" 1.0 · "שבעים" 2.7 · "שחובה לשאול" 3.6 · end 5.0

Adapt: keep the signature weight-transfer (the video YIELDS space to the hero stat in one event); change: the video stays full-bleed and yields by receding into a rounded card rather than sliding sideways, because the approved sketch keeps the footage full-frame.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.0s): footage playing full-bleed (the hand lifts the lid); the "Before I Do" Caveat wordmark (white, ~173px, LTR, centered at y≈130–300) writes itself on left→right via a soft-edged mask wipe (handwriting feel; `svg-path-draw` intent realized as a mask wipe on the text); the red heart pops in after "Do" with a small playful overshoot (the one sanctioned overshoot).
Scene 2 (1.0–2.6s): subline "משחק קלפים לזוגות מאורסים" (white 600 ~58px, centered under the wordmark) reveals per word.
Scene 3 (2.7–3.6s): YIELD — the footage recedes (scale 1.00→0.94, corners round to ~28px, a hairline `border` appears) while a white stat card rises from below into the sketch's position (x 86–994, y≈864–1060): "70" (blue 700 ~184px) counts up 0→70 as "שבעים" is spoken (`counting-dynamic-scale`).
Scene 4 (3.6–5.0s): the card's label "שאלות שחובה לשאול / לפני החתונה" (ink-deep 600 ~58px) reveals line by line beside the number. Hold.

## Selected blueprint: video-text-pivot

# video-text-pivot — Video → Text Pivot

**intent**: A product video holds center and claims attention, then slides aside to hand its weight to a hero stat in the space it vacates, then both clear and kinetic text types into the center — accent words carrying the meaning the video used to carry — sealed by a gradient pill. The arc is "show → yield → pivot → stamp," and each handoff pairs an exit with a same-anchor entrance so two beats read, not four.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `metric-video-text-pivot`): when the open is "see the feature" then "see the impact" and the `[product video]` must stay visible through the stat reveal — it slides, it doesn't cut.
- Key_Feature: a feature clip that yields to a frame-filling metric and a typographic impact line.

**duration**: 6–8s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; one `[product video]` as a real muted `.mp4` clip, a hero stat, then kinetic text — each pair shares a screen anchor so the handoff reads as a weight-transfer)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — the video shows.** The `[product video]` lands centered on a smooth scale-up and breathes (a small y-bob), claiming full attention. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.2s) — yield + stat (signature move).** The video SLIDES aside (x + scale down) **into the very space** the `[hero stat]` now fills as the stat pops in with 3D-depth type — one weight-transfer reading as a single event, not two. The stat breathes within this window.
- **Scene 3 (~3.2–5.0s) — pivot to text.** Both video and stat clear out and kinetic `[impact text]` TYPES into the vacated center, character by character; its `[accent words]` carry the meaning the video used to carry.
- **Scene 4 (~5.0–end) — stamp.** A gradient `[pill]` snaps shut around the closing line (`scaleX` 0→1), its glow halo resolving a beat behind so the silhouette reads before the bloom — sealing the statement as one graphic. Holds.

**motion vocabulary**: video scale-in + small breath; weight-transfer slide (video x + scale-down handing off to the stat at the same anchor); 3D-depth stat type; character-stream typing; gradient pill scaleX-snap; glow-halo bloom trailing the silhouette.

**rule mapping**

- video entrance (smooth) and the weight-transfer slide → `gsap-effects` (scale/opacity then x + scale on a long-tail `power3`); the video itself is a muted `<video class="clip">` direct child of the root
- hero stat's frame-filling 3D type → `3d-text-depth-layers` (static-depth variation — layers built at setup, no cascade fighting the entry)
- the same-anchor video-exit ↔ stat-entry handoff (if treated as a morph) → `scale-swap-transition` (shared center)
- character-by-character impact typing through segmented spans → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (clean character stream) or `discrete-text-sequence`
- pill `scaleX` snap + trailing glow halo → `gsap-effects` (scaleX) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (the halo, resolving a beat behind)
- video / stat breath within their windows → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, gated to each element's window, never a forever loop)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — all motion is element-space (the video translates), so the "pivot" is the elements moving, not a camera.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| token                 | range                                       | notes                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TARGET_VALUE          | 2–3 digits ideal                            | 4+ digits needs a wider container; must fit at END_SIZE without clipping      |
| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |
| COUNT_DUR             | 1.2–2.5s                                    | below ~0.8s reads as a flash — the eye must read the digits scrolling past    |
| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |
| SUFFIX_DUR            | 0.3–0.6s                                    | fires at `COUNT_DUR`, never during the count                                  |
| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
